      <p>Do you know that over million-and-a-half heart attacks happens every year, and more than 20% of people die before even reaching a hospital. Latest data shows that cardiac arrest is becoming the number one cause of death.<br><br>When the heart stops, the absence of oxygenated blood can cause permanent brain damage in only a few minutes. Death will occur within approximately 8-10 minutes.<br><br>Statistics show that the earlier CPR is initiated, the greater the chances of survival. In fact, chances of survival are doubled if help is provided within four minutes. This few minutes can be the difference between life and death.</p>

      <h1 class="w3-text-red"><strong>CPR Basics</strong></h1>
      <p>During cardiac arrest, there is no blood flow. Chest compressions create a small amount of blood flow to the vital organs such as the brain and heart - the more effective the chest compressions, the more blood flow is produced. Chest compressions that are too shallow or too slow or chest compressions that are interrupted frequently do not deliver as much blood flow to the brain and heart as effective chest compressions. Every time chest compressions are restarted following an interruption, the first few compressions are not as effective as later compressions. Frequent or prolonged interruptions in chest compressions decrease blood flow and the victim's chance of survival.<br><br>CPR may not save the victim even when performed properly, but if started within 4 minutes of cardiac arrest and defibrillation is provided within 10 minutes, a person has a 40% chance of survival.<br><br>CPR provides a trickle of oxygenated blood to the brain and heart and keeps these organs alive. In other words, Cardio Pulmonary Resuscitation (CPR) serves as an artificial heartbeat and an artificial respirator until defibrillation can shock the heart into a normal rhythm or emergency equipment arrives.<br><br>Remember the CAB's of CPR: Circulation, Airway and Breathing</p>

        <h1 class="w3-text-red"><strong>Latest AHA Guidelines Changes</strong></h1>
      <p>The AHA guidelines "strongly recommend" that untrained / lay responders perform "compression-only" CPR, sometimes known as CCR. However, medical professionals and trained lay people are still urged to give the victim two "rescue breaths" in between each series of 30 chest compressions.<br><br>All the changes apply only to adult victims who collapse of cardiac arrest; artificial respiration is still recommended for children and for adults in a few cases, including near-drowning and drug overdose.<br><br>The science behind the changes is simple. In an adult who has been breathing normally, for several minutes even after cardiac arrest there is enough oxygen in the bloodstream to maintain the heart and brain, as long as compressions circulate that oxygen.<br><br>The new guidelines also call for faster and more forceful compressions than in the past. The new standard is to compress the chest at least two inches on each push, at a rate of 100 compressions per minute. The AHA says the perfect pace is that of the Bee Gees' "Staying Alive."<br><br>There has been a change in the recommended sequence for the lone rescuer to initiate chest compressions before giving rescue breaths (C-A-B rather than A-B-C) The lone rescuer should begin CPR with 30 compressions rather than ventilation to reduce delay to first compression.<br><br>Increase the depth of chest compressions to 2 inches for adults & children and 1.5 inches for infants.</p><br>
