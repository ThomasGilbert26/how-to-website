        <h1 class="w3-text-red"><strong>Real World Scenarios Involving CPR</strong></h1>
        <p><strong>A FATHER’S DAY GIFT AT THE POOL</strong><br>Myles, my four year old, 3’6” son, had somehow left the hot tub area and gotten into the adult pool. We ran over and pulled him out of the water, only to see his blue face and grey, still body, the color of pool concrete. He was limp, lifeless, his lungs gurgling - the image of what appeared to be my dead son.<br><br>What happened next was fluid, efficient and perfectly orchestrated. One person contacted the front desk while another called 911. My friend, John Newland and I began very remedial CPR. Despite our best efforts, we failed to make any significant progress in reviving my son.<br><br>Another friend of mine realized two off-duty lifeguards, Liz and Alison Manley, were nearby. The sisters, 15 and 18, recently trained by the Red Cross in CPR, took over on compressions and breathing.<br><br>Alison took over directly above Myles and Liz near his feet. Alison started compressions, Liz gave instructions. They turned him on his side, cleared the airway as he expelled water. They continued chest compressions and rescue breathing, working feverishly yet staying calm and coordinated. They were a perfect team.<br><br>As the scene unfolded, so many things went through my mind. It seemed that seconds, minutes and hours passed, all at once. I saw his life flash before my eyes, the vivid image of my beloved son, wearing his favorite Lightning McQueen jammies and then his t-ball uniform. All at once I was filled with both regret and hope. "What kind of a father lets this happen?", "Stay with me buddy!" "C’mon Myles", "I don't want to live without you buddy!" and finally "God help, somebody, do anything!" Then it happened. Myles slowly opened one of his eyes and began to cry. I picked him up and held him.<br><br>Myles was dismissed from the hospital the next morning and, despite everything that happened, was adamant about going to Worlds of Fun. This was the best Father’s Day gift I could have ever received, watching my wife, son and daughter reunited and healthy, playing together again! No days are taken for granted any longer!<br><br><br><strong>ON THE GOLF COURSE</strong><br>Ralph Harms, 78, was playing golf with his son Joe and friend Doug Green on July 30, 2013. After a great shot at the fourth hole, Ralph remembers hollering, “Yeah, baby.” The next thing he remembers is waking up in the hospital three days later. Ralph had collapsed on the course in full cardiac arrest just seconds after that great shot. Though he says he was familiar with the signs and symptoms of a heart attack, “cardiac arrest is like walking up to a light switch and just turning it off,” he says. “There was no warning.”<br><br>About four years prior, Ralph and Joe were watching a football game together on T.V. When a commercial about CPR came on, Ralph asked his son if he was certified. The elder Harms had taken Red Cross CPR classes every two years for decades in order to keep his CPR certification active. His son had not yet done the same, and Ralph recalls getting on the floor to show Joe the proper way to do chest compressions.<br><br>“It’s a good thing Joe remembered—or I wouldn’t be here,” Ralph says. While his friend Doug called 9-1-1 with a cell phone, Joe began CPR. With paramedics en route, Ralph’s heart started and stopped three times. All the while, Joe continued chest compressions.<br><br>Ralph miraculously survived and spent three days in a drug-induced coma. Ralph knows it was his friend and son’s efforts and the CPR know-how that contributed to his survival. For that reason he shares his story.<br><br>CPR save stories can happen at work, at home, at the recreation center or even in China. </p>

      <h1 class="w3-text-red"><strong>Different Types of CPR</strong></h1>
        <p><strong>ACLS CERTIFICATION</strong><br>ACLS stands for Advanced Cardiovascular Life Support. CPR training is one technique of the Advanced Cardiac Life Support algorithm.  This course teaches all the aspects of what a healthcare professional would do when faced with a emergency.<br><br>ACLS training is meant for health care professionals that deal with emergencies related to adults.  This includes doctors, nurses, respiratory therapists, and paramedics.  Students need to know how to read ECG rhythms and identify the proper medication doses for the patient.<br><br>During an ACLS certification class, students will learn about the following topics:<br><ul><li>How to identify and manage respiratory and cardiac arrest</li><li>Airway management</li><li>ACLS pharmacology terms and definitions</li><li>Basic life support (BLS) review</li><li>How to manage acute coronary syndromes and stroke</li><li>How to contribute to a resuscitation team as both a leader and team member</li></ul><br>The benefits of ACLS certification training include:<br><ul><li><strong>World-Class Lessons:</strong> Students can gain deep insights into how to provide proper support during cardiac arrest emergencies and other critical situations.</li><li><strong>Hands-On Classroom Training:</strong>  ACLS certification programs require hands-on training to ensure each student is fully prepared to provide life-saving assistance in emergencies.</li><li><strong>Engaging Learning Experience: </strong>During an ACLS class, students are encouraged to ask questions and participate in discussions to gain the insights they need to thrive in life-threatening scenarios.</li></ul><br>Usually, an individual can complete an ACLS class in one day. An initial ACLS certification class often requires about 12 hours to complete. Comparatively, an ACLS renewal course takes about six hours to finish.<br><br>Upon successful completion of an ACLS certification class, a student will receive a certification card that will remain valid for two years. Typically, the certification card will be given to a student on the same day that he or she finishes the class.<br><br>All ACLS classes are taught by experienced medical and healthcare personnel. This means that students can receive guidance from expert instructors who have served as firefighters, nurses and paramedics.<br><br><br><strong>PALS CERTIFICATION</strong><br>PALS training is ideal for healthcare professionals and medical personnel who may encounter pediatric emergencies. The training emphasizes a variety of topics, including:<br><ul><li>How to take a systematic approach to pediatric assessment</li><li>The importance of proper management of pediatric respiratory emergencies</li><li>Vascular access</li><li>Airway management</li><li>PALS pharmacology terms and definitions</li><li>Evaluation of various pediatric case studies and simulations</li></ul><br>PALS training offers many benefits, including:<br><ul><li><strong>Advanced Training:</strong> PALS training focuses on the challenges of pediatric emergency management and teaches students how to deliver life-saving support to infants and children.</li><li><strong>Scenario-Based Lessons:</strong> During a PALS class, a student will be exposed to a variety of real world emergencies that involve infants and children.</li><li><strong>Comprehensive Insights:</strong> A PALS class is always taught by an experienced medical professional who can offer extensive insights into a broad range of adolescent emergency topics.</li></ul><br>An individual will be able to complete a PALS class over the course of one to two days. An initial PALS class requires about 12 hours to complete, while a PALS renewal course takes roughly six hours to finish. Furthermore, each student will receive PALS certification that remains valid for two years upon successful completion of a PALS class.<br><br><br><strong>NRP CERTIFICATION</strong><br>NRP training is recommended for healthcare personnel who are involved in the delivery of newborns. Healthcare professionals who may benefit from NRP certification include:<br><ul><li>Labor and Delivery Nurses</li><li>Neonate Intensive Care Unit (NICU) Nurses</li><li>Respiratory therapists</li><li>NICU Physicians</li></ul><br><ul><li>The identification and use of neonatal resuscitation equipment</li><li> Initial assessments of newborns</li><li>Positive pressure ventilation</li><li>How to perform neonatal CPR and intubation</li><li>Medication dosing and administration</li><li>The use of neonate skills in an emergency (neonatal megacode)</li></ul><br>The benefits of enrolling in an NRP class include:<br><ul><li><strong>In-Depth Lessons:</strong> The NRP course consists of three components: a self-paced online training module with simulated scenarios, hands-on skills practice in person with an instructor and a hands-on skills test with an instructor. This ensures students are able to build their confidence by asking questions and practicing the skills they will need in an emergency.</li><li><strong>Expert Support:</strong> An NRP class features an expert instructor that works in the NICU who is happy to help students become key contributors in a neonatal emergency.</li></ul><br>In many instances, NRP certification is mandatory for all healthcare personnel who work in labor and delivery and the NICU. The certification will stay active for two years. Plus, after a student successfully completes an NRP training program, he or she will be able to receive a certification card on the same day.<br><br><br><strong>BASIC LIFE SUPPORT CPR TRAINING</strong><br>CPR Training for healthcare providers, also know as Basic Life Support (BLS) for Healthcare providers is a required pre-requisite for all the advanced classes mentioned above.<br><br>The benefits of BLS training include:<br><ul><li><strong>One-of-a-Kind Learning Experience:</strong> Many BLS classes feature instructors who work in the healthcare or medical field and can provide students with an informative and engaging CPR learning experience.</li><li><strong>Immense Flexibility:</strong> Many BLS training programs are available in cities and towns nationwide, ensuring anyone can learn the ins and outs of CPR at their convenience.</li></ul><br>A BLS course is highly recommended for anyone who works in the healthcare field.  That includes doctors, nurses, dentists, EMTs, medical assistants, paramedics, fire fighters, dental assistants, and many more.  Any person who is a professional and works with patients will need the BLS course.<br><br>When you finish your BLS course, you will be provided with a certification card that will be effective for two years. It is very important for those who have been previously certified to continue to keep up with the changes in the field of CPR and various other trainings. Changes and updates in the field do happen and techniques do change. Therefore, maintaining an honest approach to one’s certification is very important.<br><br>Getting certified in BLS, ACLS, PALS, etc. is as easy as finding a location that is convenient to the individual and remaining committed to the program. Most places will provide honest feedback and a friendly and open environment. In addition, they will also be extremely professional and take the training very seriously; as should the individual who has signed up for the course.</p>
